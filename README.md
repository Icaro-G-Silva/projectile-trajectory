# Projectile Trajectory
> Calculates and plot the graph of a projectile trajectory

## Objectives
+ Learn more about code in C and Python;
+ Learn more about Data Visualization;
+ Interact with two distinct programs

## How's it works?
C program calculates the exact position of a projectile in determinate time, and then generate a file with the data. After that a Python program collect that data and plot the graph of the projectile's trajectory. <br>
For you to use is simple, just clone it into your computer and execute the executable in "build" folder.
